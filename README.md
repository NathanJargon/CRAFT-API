## Rationale

In the ever-changing world of education, we're introducing a **Collaborative Resource and Feedback Tool**, a student profiling system designed to simplify student life and contribute to community development.

Here's how CRAFT API works: 
1. Entity send students a registration and survey form.
2. Students complete it by submitting their certificate of registration and responses.
3. Their essential information and schedules, all neatly stored in a central database.
4. Retrieve useful information from the analysis of the data.

What makes this system even more remarkable is its dual benefit. It helps inter-departments-organizations allocate resources effectively to those in need and provides students with tailored opportunities that align with their academic path. Beyond that, it plays a crucial role in community development, creating a stronger, more connected campus environment.



## Objective

**Scheduler**

> Provides information about a certain population's availability levels. It provides insight into whether a specific date is appropriate for the target audience.


**Profiling**

> The focal entity can select predefined questions to the target population and a survey form will be distributed to the students and collected to a database for analysis. The benefit of this rather than a regular survey can detect changes or patterns over time that could serve as an opening to potential research areas and development.



## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/USTP-CS3/CRAFT-API.git`
1. Install packages with `pnpm install`
2. Open `db/database.js` then configure the connection.
3. Run `pnpm sync` to synchronize models to the database.
4. Run `pnpm start` to execute main.js


## Dependencies
- **Winston**   - used for creating formatted logs

- **Chalk**     - used with winston to color logs

- **Sequelize** - an object-relational mapping library

- **MySQL2**    - mysql client for node.js

- **Pdf2Json**  - used to extract text in pdf files.


## Directories

- **db**    - database related files

- **model** - object-relation mapping

- **util**  - executable scripts

- **lib**   - development modules

- **misc**  - miscellaneous files

- **log**   - winston generated logs
