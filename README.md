## Rationale

In the ever-changing world of education, we're introducing a Collaborative Resource and Feedback Tool (CRAFT API), a student profiling system designed to simplify student life and contribute to community development.

Here's how CRAFT API works: 
1. Entity send students a registration and survey form.
2. Students complete it by submitting their certificate of registration and responses.
3. Their essential information and schedules, all neatly stored in a central database.
4. Retrieve useful information from the analysis of the data.

What makes this system even more remarkable is its dual benefit. It helps inter-departments-organizations allocate resources effectively to those in need and provides students with tailored opportunities that align with their academic path. Beyond that, it plays a crucial role in community development, creating a stronger, more connected campus environment.



## Objective

**Scheduler**
> Provides information about a certain population's availability levels. It provides insight into whether a specific date is appropriate for the target audience.

**Profiling**
> The focal entity can select predefined questions to the target population and a survey form will be distributed to the students and collected to a database for analysis. The benefit of this rather than a regular survey can detect changes or patterns over time that could serve as an opening to potential research areas and development.

## Project Design

**Class::Extractor - extracts and caches the content of _google form responses_ and _pdf_ files**

**Class::Surveyor - generates predefined surveys aligned with profiling design**
